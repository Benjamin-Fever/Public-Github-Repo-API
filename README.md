<h1>Public Github Repo API</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a AWS API created utilizeing multiple AWS tools such as Lambda, Systems Manager and Api gateway. This is a simple api the fetches the data for my public repo's here on github and provides data for my static github page to load into the
portfolio section. This is because github static pages don't allow for nodejs code and a this would expose my github public key. All this data is public on this github
so no authentication would be needed, link to api: https://vw6zd6gcme.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/data
  
<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This was a small but interesting project to apply networking skills and learn the ropes of the AWS system and its complexities
